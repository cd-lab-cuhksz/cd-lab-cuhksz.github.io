        About our work
      text: |
        We are currently working on the following research:
        
        - **Stable AI Control Theory**

        Developing stability-guaranteed data-driven control methods that systematically integrate learning and control, establishing a theoretical foundation for reliable AI operation in dynamic environments.
        - **Physical Model Development**
        
        Investigating how embodied agents can learn and internalize physical models from data, enabling robots to effectively understand and learn the physical characteristics of the real world.
        - **Embodied Control Systems**
        
        Researching whole-body dynamic stability control and adaptive generalization strategies, facilitated by physics-aware execution, to achieve more stable, practical, and physically consistent robotic behaviors.
        - **Reliable Learning Control**
        
        Constructing safety-guaranteed learning control algorithms to enhance adaptability and generalization in complex environments, promoting the reliable deployment of intelligent control systems in real-world applications.
