      - title: About our work
        content: |
          We are currently working on the following research:
          
          - **Stable AI Control Theory**

          Developing stability-guaranteed data-driven control methods that systematically integrate learning and control, establishing a theoretical foundation for reliable AI operation in dynamic environments.
          - **Physical Model Development**
          
          Investigating how embodied agents can learn and internalize physical models from data, enabling robots to effectively understand and learn the physical characteristics of the real world.
          - **Embodied Control Systems**
          
          Researching whole-body dynamic stability control and adaptive generalization strategies, facilitated by physics-aware execution, to achieve more stable, practical, and physically consistent robotic behaviors.
          - **Reliable Learning Control**
          
          Constructing safety-guaranteed learning control algorithms to enhance adaptability and generalization in complex environments, promoting the reliable deployment of intelligent control systems in real-world applications.
