abstract: Wheeled-biped robots, which integrate the high-speed, energy-efficient mobility of wheeled robots with the terrain adaptability of legged robots, have been widely applied in diverse scenarios. However, its underactuated and non-minimumphase characteristics pose significant challenges for stabilization control. While the IDA-PBC method has been widely adopted for stabilizing underactuated systems, its direct application to NMP systems exhibits inherent performance limitations due to unstable internal dynamics. To address this fundamental constraint, this work proposes a transformation of the NMP stabilization problem into an equivalent minimum-phase framework via the Equivalent Output Approach. By reconstructing the system output while preserving equilibrium properties, we enable the synthesis of an IDA-PBC controller that achieves asymptotic stabilization for the wheeled-biped robot. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
